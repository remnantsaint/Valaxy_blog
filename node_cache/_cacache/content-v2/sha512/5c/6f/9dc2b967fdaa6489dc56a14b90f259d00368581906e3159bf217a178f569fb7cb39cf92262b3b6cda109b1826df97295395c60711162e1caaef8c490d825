This is similar the built in method [replace](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace#Specifying_a_string_as_a_parameter).\n\n```\n// happybirthday.txt\nHappy birthday to you!\nHappy birthday to you!\nHappy birthday to dear Liza!\nHappy birthday to you!\n```\n\n``` js\nvar replaceStream = require('replacestream')\n  , fs = require('fs')\n  , path = require('path');\n\n// Replace any word that has an 'o' with 'oh'\nfs.createReadStream(path.join(__dirname, 'happybirthday.txt'))\n  .pipe(replaceStream(/(dear) (Liza!)/, 'my very good and $1 friend $2'))\n  .pipe(process.stdout);\n```\n\nRunning this will print:\n\n``` bash\n$ node simple.js\nHappy birthday to you!\nHappy birthday to you!\nHappy birthday to my very good and dear friend Liza!\nHappy birthday to you!\n```\n\nYou can also pass in a replacement function. The function will be passed parameters just like [String.prototype.replace](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace) (e.g. replaceFunction(match, p1, p2, offset, string)). In this case the matched string is limited to the buffer the match is found on, not the entire stream.\n\n``` js\nfunction replaceFn() {\n  return arguments[2] + ' to ' + arguments[1]\n}\nfs.createReadStream(path.join(__dirname, 'happybirthday.txt'))\n  .pipe(replaceStream(/(birt\\w*)\\sto\\s(you)/g, replaceFn))\n  .pipe(process.stdout);\n```\n\nWhich would output:\n\n``` bash\n$ node simple.js\nHappy you to birthday!\nHappy you to birthday!\nHappy birthday to dear Liza!\nHappy you to birthday!\n```\n\n### Web server search and replace over a test file\n\nHere's the same example, but kicked off from a HTTP server:\n\n``` js\n// server.js\nvar http = require('http')\n  , fs = require('fs')\n  , path = require('path')\n  , replaceStream = require('replacestream');\n\nvar app = function (req, res) {\n  if (req.url.match(/^\\/happybirthday\\.txt$/)) {\n    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });\n    fs.createReadStream(path.join(__dirname, 'happybirthday.txt'))\n      .pipe(replaceStream('birthday', 'earthday'))\n      .pipe(res);\n  } else {\n    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });\n    res.end('File not found');\n  }\n};\nvar server = http.createServer(app).listen(3000);\n```\n\nWhen you request the file:\n```\n$ curl -i \"http://localhost:3000/happybirthday.txt\"\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/plain\nDate: Mon, 08 Jul 2013 06:45:21 GMT\nConnection: keep-alive\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\n\nHappy earthday to you!\nHappy earthday to you!\nHappy earthday to dear Liza!\nHappy earthday to you!\n```\n\nNB: If your readable Stream that you're piping through the `replacestream` is\npaused, then you may have to call the `.resume()` method on it.\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Changing the encoding\n\nYou can also change the text encoding of the search and replace by setting an\nencoding property on the options object:\n\n``` js\n// Replace the first 2 of the instances of 'birthday' with 'earthday'\nfs.createReadStream(path.join(__dirname, 'happybirthday.txt'))\n  .pipe(replaceStream('birthday', 'earthday', { limit: 2, encoding: 'ascii' } ))\n  .pipe(process.stdout);\n```\n\nBy default the encoding will be set to 'utf8'.\n\n## List of options\n\nOption        | Default   | Description\n------        | -------   | -----------\nlimit         | Infinity  | Sets a limit on the number of times the replacement will be made. This is forced to one when a regex without the global flag is provided.\nencoding      | utf8      | The text encoding used during search and replace.\nmaxMatchLen   | 100       | When doing cross-chunk replacing, this sets the maximum length match that will be supported.\nignoreCase    | true      | When doing string match (not relevant for regex matching) whether to do a case insensitive search.\nregExpOptions | undefined | (Deprecated) When provided, these flags will be used when creating the search regexes internally. This functionality is deprecated as the flags set on the regex provided are no longer mutated if this is not provided.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### What does \"chunk boundary friendly\" mean?\n\nIt means that a replace should happen even if the string to be replaced is between streaming chunks of data. For example, say I do something like this\n\n```js\nfs.createReadStream(path.join(__dirname, 'happybirthday.txt'))\n  .pipe(replaceStream('birthday', 'earthday'))\n  .pipe(process.stdout);\n```\n\nHere i am trying to replace all instances of `'birthday'` with `'earthday'`. Let's say the first chunk of data that is available is `'happy birth'` and the second chunk of data available is `'day'`. In this case the replace will happen successfully, the same as it would have if the chunk contained the entire string that was to be replaced (e.g. `chunk1 = 'happy' chunk2 = 'birthday'`)\n\n### Does that apply across more than 2 chunks? How does it work with regexes?\n\nIt does apply across multiple chunks. By default, however, the maximum match length (`maxMatchLen`) is set to 100 characters. You can increase this by adding `maxMatchLen: x` to your options:\n\n```js\nreplacestream('hi', 'bye', {maxMatchLen: 1000})\n```\n\nA string the size of `maxMatchLen` will be saved in memory so it shouldn't be set too high. `maxMatchLen` is what allows us to have a match between chunks. We are saving `maxMatchLen` characters in a string (the last `maxMatchLen` characters from the previous chunks) that we prepend to the current chunk, then attempt to find a match.\n\nAs for regex it works exactly the same except you would pass a regular expression into replacestream:\n\n```js\nreplacestream(/a+/, 'b')\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nreplacestream is an **OPEN Open Source Project**.
