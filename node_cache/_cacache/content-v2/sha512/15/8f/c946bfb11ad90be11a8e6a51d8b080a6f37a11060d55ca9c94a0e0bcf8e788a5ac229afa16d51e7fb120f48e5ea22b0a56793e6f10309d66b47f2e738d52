Defaults to `require` but you may choose to pass the name of a custom shim function; for example, `__webpack_require__` may work for webpack in the browser.\n\n## License\n\nMIT © [Luke Edwards](https://lukeed.com)\n","time":{"created":"2022-01-26T21:08:12.761Z","modified":"2022-01-26T21:08:12.761Z","3.0.0":"2021-06-03T23:48:57.462Z","2.0.3":"2019-04-04T21:17:21.836Z","2.0.2":"2019-04-04T08:06:38.523Z","2.0.1":"2019-01-20T22:19:25.586Z","2.0.0":"2019-01-09T03:05:07.669Z","1.4.0":"2018-11-22T19:48:36.870Z","1.3.2":"2018-10-13T17:06:27.099Z","1.3.1":"2018-08-28T05:31:53.453Z","1.3.0":"2018-08-24T04:05:49.590Z","1.2.0":"2018-08-13T19:15:10.261Z","1.1.1":"2018-08-10T18:34:24.323Z","1.1.0":"2018-08-08T08:37:28.364Z","1.0.0":"2017-07-25T22:32:40.855Z"},"versions":{"3.0.0":{"version":"3.0.0","name":"rewrite-imports","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/lukeed/rewrite-imports.git"},"description":"A tiny (349B) utility to rewrite `import` statements as `require()`s;
