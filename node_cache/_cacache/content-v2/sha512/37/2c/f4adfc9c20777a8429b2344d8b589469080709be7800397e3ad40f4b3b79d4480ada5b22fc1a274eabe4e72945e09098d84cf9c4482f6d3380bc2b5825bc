It's a great library and provides a powerful editor out of the box. Anyway, there were couple of problems related to the setup process. The main problem is the need to do some additional `webpack` configuration; that's not bad, but some quite useful tools, like `CRA`, aren't happy with that fact. The library [`@monaco-editor/react`](https://github.com/suren-atoyan/monaco-react) was being created to solve that problem - `monaco editor wrapper for easy/one-line integration with React applications without needing to use webpack's (or any other module bundler's) configuration files`. In that library, there was a utility that cares about the initialization process of monaco and overcomes the additional use of webpack configuration. That utility grows over time and now it's a separate library. Now, you can easily setup monaco into your browser, create your own editors, wrappers for React/Vue/Angular of whatever you want.\n\n## How it works\n\nMonaco editor provides a script called `loader`, which itself provides tooling to download monaco sources. The library, under the hood, handles the configuration and loading part and gives us an easy-to-use API to interact with it\n\n## Documentation\n\n#### Contents\n\n* [Installation](#installation)\n* [Introduction](#introduction)\n* [Usage](#usage)\n  * [.config](#config)\n  * [.init](#init)\n* [Notes](#notes)\n  * [For `electron` users](#for-electron-users)\n  * [For `Next.js` users](#for-nextjs-users)\n\n### Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install @monaco-editor/loader\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\nyarn add @monaco-editor/loader\n```\n\nNOTE: For TypeScript type definitions, this package uses the [monaco-editor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/monaco-editor) package as a peer dependency. So, if you need types and don't already have the [monaco-editor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/monaco-editor) package installed, you will need to do so.\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe library exports types and the utility called `loader`, the last one has two methods\n\n* [.config](#config)\n* [.init](#init)\n\n### Usage\n\n```javascript\nimport loader from '@monaco-editor/loader';\n\nloader.init().then(monaco => {\n  monaco.editor.create(/* editor container, e.g. document.body */, {\n    value: '// some comment',\n    language: 'javascript',\n  });\n});\n```\n\n[codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/simple-usage-os49p)\n\n#### .config\n\nBy using the `.config` method we can configure the monaco loader. By default all sources come from CDN, you can change that behavior and load them from wherever you want\n\n```javascript\nimport loader from '@monaco-editor/loader';\n\n// you can change the source of the monaco files\nloader.config({ paths: { vs: '...' } });\n\n// you can configure the locales\nloader.config({ 'vs/nls': { availableLanguages: { '*': 'de' } } });\n\n// or\nloader.config({\n  paths: {\n    vs: '...',\n  },\n  'vs/nls' : {\n    availableLanguages: {\n      '*': 'de',\n    },\n  },\n});\n\nloader.init().then(monaco => { /* ... */ });\n```\n\n[codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/config-o6zn6)\n\n#### Configure the loader to load the monaco as an npm package\n\n```javascript\nimport loader from '@monaco-editor/loader';\nimport * as monaco from 'monaco-editor';\n\nloader.config({ monaco });\n\nloader.init().then(monacoInstance => { /* ... */ });\n```\n\n[codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/npm-gswrvh)\n\n#### .init\n\nThe `.init` method handles the initialization process. It returns the monaco instance, wrapped with cancelable promise\n\n```javascript\nimport loader from '@monaco-editor/loader';\n\nloader.init().then(monaco => {\n  console.log('Here is the monaco instance', monaco);\n});\n```\n\n[codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/init-q2ipt)\n\n```javascript\nimport loader from '@monaco-editor/loader';\n\nconst cancelable = loader.init();\n\ncancelable.then(monaco => {\n  console.log('You will not see it, as it is canceled');\n});\n\ncancelable.cancel();\n```\n\n[codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/init-cancelable-9o42y)\n\n#### Notes\n\n##### For `electron` users\n\nIn general it works fine with electron, but there are several cases that developers usually face to and sometimes it can be confusing. Here they are:\n\n1) **Download process fails** or if you use @monaco-editor/react **You see loading screen stuck**\nUsually, it's because your environment doesn't allow you to load external sources. By default, it loads monaco sources from CDN. You can see the [default configuration](https://github.com/suren-atoyan/monaco-loader/blob/master/src/config/index.js#L3). But sure you can change that behavior; the library is fully configurable. Read about it [here](https://github.com/suren-atoyan/monaco-loader#config). So, if you want to download it from your local files, you can do it like this:\n\n```javascript\nimport loader from '@monaco-editor/loader';\n\nloader.config({ paths: { vs: '../path-to-monaco' } });\n```\n\nor, if you want to use it as an npm package, you can do it like this:\n\n```javascript\nimport loader from '@monaco-editor/loader';\nimport * as monaco from 'monaco-editor';\n\nloader.config({ monaco });\n\nloader.init().then(monacoInstance => { /* ... */ });\n```\n\n2) **Based on your electron environment it can be required to have an absolute URL**\nThe utility function taken from [here](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor-samples/blob/master/electron-amd-nodeIntegration/electron-index.html) can help you to achieve that. Let's imagine you have `monaco-editor` package installed and you want to load monaco from the `node_modules` rather than from CDN: in that case, you can write something like this:\n\n```javascript\nfunction ensureFirstBackSlash(str) {\n    return str.length > 0 && str.charAt(0) !== '/'\n        ? '/' + str\n        : str;\n}\n\nfunction uriFromPath(_path) {\n    const pathName = path.resolve(_path).replace(/\\\\/g, '/');\n    return encodeURI('file://' + ensureFirstBackSlash(pathName));\n}\n\nloader.config({\n  paths: {\n    vs: uriFromPath(\n      path.join(__dirname, '../node_modules/monaco-editor/min/vs')\n    )\n  }\n});\n```\n\nor, just use it as an npm package.\n\nThere were several issues about this topic that can be helpful too - [1](https://github.com/suren-atoyan/monaco-react/issues/48) [2](https://github.com/suren-atoyan/monaco-react/issues/12) [3](https://github.com/suren-atoyan/monaco-react/issues/58) [4](https://github.com/suren-atoyan/monaco-react/issues/87)\n\nAnd if you use `electron` with `monaco` and have faced an issue different than the above-discribed ones, please let us know to make this section more helpful.\n\n##### For `Next.js` users\n\nThe part of the source that should be pre-parsed is optimized for server-side rendering, so, in usual cases, it will work fine, but if you want to have access, for example, to [`monacoInstance`](#config) you should be aware that it wants to access the `document` object, and it requires browser environment. Basically you just need to avoid running that part out of browser environment, there are several ways to do that. One of them is described [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import#with-no-ssr).\n\nAnd if you use `monaco` with `Next.js` and have faced an issue different than the above-described one, please let us know to make this section more helpful.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](./LICENSE)\n","time":{"created":"2022-01-27T10:50:42.583Z","modified":"2023-10-01T23:23:46.557Z","1.2.0":"2021-10-03T13:20:58.715Z","1.1.1":"2021-06-21T05:18:50.819Z","1.1.0":"2021-06-12T19:45:13.629Z","1.0.1":"2021-03-18T07:49:05.271Z","1.0.0":"2021-01-15T00:26:33.518Z","0.1.3":"2021-01-09T14:26:22.462Z","0.1.2":"2021-01-07T09:24:41.443Z","0.1.1":"2021-01-06T22:03:01.311Z","0.1.0":"2021-01-06T19:33:23.987Z","1.3.0":"2022-03-20T14:23:51.256Z","1.3.1":"2022-04-23T16:08:44.716Z","1.3.2":"2022-05-11T11:15:06.746Z","1.3.3":"2023-04-02T17:40:13.473Z","1.4.0":"2023-10-01T23:23:12.395Z"},"versions":{"1.2.0":{"name":"@monaco-editor/loader","version":"1.2.0","description":"the library aims to setup monaco editor into your browser","main":"lib/cjs/index.js","module":"lib/es/index.js","unpkg":"lib/umd/monaco-loader.min.js","jsdelivr":"lib/umd/monaco-loader.min.js","types":"lib/types.d.ts","repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/suren-atoyan/monaco-loader.git"},"homepage":"https://github.com/suren-atoyan/monaco-loader.git","author":{"name":"Suren Atoyan","email":"contact@surenatoyan.com"},"license":"MIT","scripts":{"test":"jest","test-watch":"npm run build && jest --watch","coverage":"jest --collect-coverage","lint":"npx eslint src","prepublish":"npm test && npm run lint && npm run build","build":"rollup -c && cp ./src/types.d.ts ./lib/"},"peerDependencies":{"monaco-editor":">= 0.21.0 < 1"},"keywords":["monaco","editor","loader","monaco-editor","monaco editor"],"devDependencies":{"@babel/core":"^7.11.0","@babel/preset-env":"^7.11.0","@rollup/plugin-babel":"^5.2.2","@rollup/plugin-commonjs":"^17.0.0","@rollup/plugin-node-resolve":"^11.0.1","@rollup/plugin-replace":"^2.3.4","babel-jest":"^26.2.2","babel-loader":"^8.1.0","eslint":"^7.6.0","husky":"^4.2.5","jest":"^26.2.2","rollup":"^2.35.1","rollup-plugin-terser":"^7.0.2"},"dependencies":{"state-local":"^1.0.6"},"licenseText":"MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2021 Suren Atoyan\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
