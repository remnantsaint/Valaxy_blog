Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/resolve-cwd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/resolve-cwd)\n\n> Resolve the path of a module like [`require.resolve()`](https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_require_resolve) but from the current working directory\n\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install resolve-cwd\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst resolveCwd = require('resolve-cwd');\n\nconsole.log(__dirname);\n//=> '/Users/sindresorhus/rainbow'\n\nconsole.log(process.cwd());\n//=> '/Users/sindresorhus/unicorn'\n\nconsole.log(resolveCwd('./foo'));\n//=> '/Users/sindresorhus/unicorn/foo.js'\n```\n\n\n## API\n\n### resolveCwd(moduleId)\n\nLike `require()`, throws when the module can't be found.\n\n### resolveCwd.silent(moduleId)\n\nReturns `undefined` instead of throwing when the module can't be found.\n\n#### moduleId\n\nType: `string`\n\nWhat you would use in `require()`.\n\n\n## Related\n\n- [resolve-from](https://github.com/sindresorhus/resolve-from) - Resolve the path of a module from a given path\n-
