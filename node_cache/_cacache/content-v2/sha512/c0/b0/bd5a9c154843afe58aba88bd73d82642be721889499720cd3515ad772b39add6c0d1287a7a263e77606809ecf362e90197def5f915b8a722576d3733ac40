For example expressions `typeof A` and `typeof (A)` are formatted differently but have the same AST representation as far as the plugin is concerned. In those situations the default is to raise an error, and can be overwritten by setting the option `allowConflictingReplacements` to `true`. \n\nYou can also always give the replacements as an array of key-value pairs. When `allowConflictingReplacements` is set to `true` the _last_ conflicting replacement gets selected.\n\n```js\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    [\n      \"babel-plugin-transform-replace-expressions\",\n      {\n        \"replace\": [\n          [\"typeof A\", \"B\"],\n          [\"typeof (A)\", \"C\"]\n        ],\n        \"allowConflictingReplacements\": true\n      }\n    ]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n * Replacements are only applied to expressions. Therefore replacing `DEBUG` with `false` in `const DEBUG = true` does nothing, but for `if (DEBUG) {}` the result is `if (false) {}`.\n \n * Only *full* expressions count. You can't replace `env` in `process.env.NODE_ENV`, you have to replace `process.env`, which is a proper expression in Babel AST.\n \n * A replacement is only applied when the result is valid JavaScript. For example replacing `a` with `2` in the following code:\n \n   ```js\n   a = 1;\n   b = a;\n   ```\n   \n   yields\n   \n   ```js\n   a = 1;\n   b = 2;\n   ```\n\n## License\n\nThis plugin is licensed under the MIT license.
