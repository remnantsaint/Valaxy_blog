Prompts for [conventional changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) standard.\n\n## Configuration\n\n### package.json\n\nLike commitizen, you specify the configuration of cz-conventional-changelog through the package.json's `config.commitizen` key.\n\n```json5\n{\n// ...  default values\n    \"config\": {\n        \"commitizen\": {\n            \"path\": \"./node_modules/cz-conventional-changelog\",\n            \"disableScopeLowerCase\": false,\n            \"disableSubjectLowerCase\": false,\n            \"maxHeaderWidth\": 100,\n            \"maxLineWidth\": 100,\n            \"defaultType\": \"\",\n            \"defaultScope\": \"\",\n            \"defaultSubject\": \"\",\n            \"defaultBody\": \"\",\n            \"defaultIssues\": \"\",\n            \"types\": {\n              ...\n              \"feat\": {\n                \"description\": \"A new feature\",\n                \"title\": \"Features\"\n              },\n              ...\n            }\n        }\n    }\n// ...\n}\n```\n\n### Environment variables\n\nThe following environment varibles can be used to override any default configuration or package.json based configuration.\n\n* CZ_TYPE = defaultType\n* CZ_SCOPE = defaultScope\n* CZ_SUBJECT = defaultSubject\n* CZ_BODY = defaultBody\n* CZ_MAX_HEADER_WIDTH = maxHeaderWidth\n* CZ_MAX_LINE_WIDTH = maxLineWidth\n\n### Commitlint\n\nIf using the [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) js library, the \"maxHeaderWidth\" configuration property will default to the configuration of the \"header-max-length\" rule instead of the hard coded value of 100.  This can be ovewritten by setting the 'maxHeaderWidth' configuration in package.json or the CZ_MAX_HEADER_WIDTH environment variable.\n","time":{"created":"2022-01-26T13:56:19.259Z","modified":"2024-09-05T21:34:05.737Z","3.3.0":"2020-08-26T18:43:16.534Z","3.2.1":"2020-08-24T18:47:35.367Z","3.2.0":"2020-05-04T21:09:58.398Z","3.1.1":"2020-05-04T19:28:12.394Z","3.1.0":"2020-01-28T12:54:14.990Z","3.0.3":"2020-01-28T12:49:41.934Z","3.0.2":"2019-07-21T12:20:18.272Z","3.0.1":"2019-07-19T20:18:57.482Z","3.0.0":"2019-07-19T19:43:50.920Z","2.1.0":"2017-10-27T11:23:37.955Z","2.0.0":"2017-02-21T16:02:51.979Z","1.2.0":"2016-08-14T13:17:18.639Z","1.1.7":"2016-08-07T16:01:49.787Z","1.1.6":"2016-04-21T22:29:04.729Z","1.1.5":"2015-12-02T14:35:58.351Z","1.1.4":"2015-10-08T18:04:21.422Z","1.1.3":"2015-10-08T17:56:24.349Z","1.1.2":"2015-09-28T02:16:48.665Z","1.1.1":"2015-09-23T14:29:15.518Z","1.1.0":"2015-05-06T20:28:32.128Z","1.0.1":"2015-04-24T11:25:29.670Z","1.0.0":"2015-04-20T17:15:14.939Z"},"versions":{"3.3.0":{"name":"cz-conventional-changelog","version":"3.3.0","description":"Commitizen
