The user might have the `node` binary in a non-standard location. They might be using a Node.js version manager like `nvm`, which is sourced in a subshell and not available from the outside. Or they might have `node` installed as a local dependency in an npm project. It also depends from where you're trying to run it. For example, GUI apps on macOS doesn't inherit the [`$PATH`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)), so the `node` binary would not be found. Most projects that depend on Node.js just end up telling the user to manually set the full path to the `node` binary in some project specific settings. Now every project has to do this. [Ugh...](https://gist.github.com/cookrn/4015437) I prefer things to *just* work. With this module it will.\n\nThis Bash script uses some tricks to find the Node.js binary on your system and run it.\n\nCan be used from any environment that can spawn a process (Shell, Python, Ruby, Swift, Objective-C, etc).\n\n### npm\n\n#### Install\n\n```\n$ npm install run-node\n```\n\n#### Usage\n\n```\n$ ./node_modules/.bin/run-node file.js\n```\n\nOr in an [npm run script](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script):\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"start\": \"run-node file.js\"\n}\n```\n\nIf the [`node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node) package is found in the local `node_modules` directory (for instance, if you have it installed as a [devDependency](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#devdependencies) of your npm project), this is the `node` binary that will be used.\n\n### Manually\n\n#### Install\n\nDownload the [run-node](run-node) file:\n\n```\n$ curl -sSLO https://github.com/sindresorhus/run-node/raw/master/run-node && chmod +x run-node\n```\n\n#### Usage\n\n```\n./run-node file.js\n```\n\n#### Customizable cache path and error message\n\nThe cache path and error message are defined by the `RUN_NODE_CACHE_PATH` and `RUN_NODE_ERROR_MSG` environment variables. You could use them in a script or add them to your `~.bashrc`.\n\nDefault config:\n\n```sh\nexport RUN_NODE_ERROR_MSG=\"Couldn't find the Node.js binary. Ensure you have Node.js installed. Open an issue on https://github.com/sindresorhus/run-node\"\nexport RUN_NODE_CACHE_PATH=\"/home/username/.node_path\"\n```\n\nIf the `RUN_NODE_CACHE_PATH` environment variable is defined explicitly, the script it points to will be sourced before looking for a `node` binary. You can use this script to override your `PATH` variable so that a specific `node` binary is found.\n\n## Maintainers\n\n- [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus)\n- [Mathias
