This plugin is for them. After TypeDoc has finished converting packages, it will look for types which are referenced, but not exported, and place them into an internal module for that entry point (called `<internal>` by default).\n\nIf your project references classes which are built into the language (e.g. `HTMLElement`), this package _will_ result in those types being documented too. If you want to prevent this, set TypeDoc's `excludeExternals` option to `true`. The default pattern for determining if a symbol is external will exclude everything within `node_modules`.\n\n### Usage\n\n```bash\nnpm install typedoc-plugin-missing-exports\nnpx typedoc --plugin typedoc-plugin-missing-exports\n```\n\n### Options\n\n- `internalModule` - Define the name of the module that internal symbols which are not exported should be placed into, defaults to `<internal>`.\n- `collapseInternalModule` - Include JS in the page to collapse all `<internal>` entries in the navigation on page load.\n- `placeInternalsInOwningModule` - Disable creating a module for internal symbols, and instead place them into the referencing module.\n\n### Additional Reading\n\n- https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc/issues/1657\n","time":{"created":"2022-01-28T00:05:12.905Z","modified":"2024-06-22T15:03:31.169Z","0.22.6":"2021-11-25T01:35:39.017Z","0.22.5":"2021-11-25T00:26:31.025Z","0.22.4":"2021-11-06T21:19:41.962Z","0.22.3":"2021-09-15T12:48:53.679Z","0.22.2":"2021-09-15T12:43:40.396Z","0.22.1":"2021-09-04T16:00:03.316Z","0.22.0":"2021-09-04T15:48:23.613Z","0.23.0":"2022-06-26T22:12:14.730Z","1.0.0":"2022-08-13T04:08:20.327Z","2.0.0":"2023-04-16T03:09:42.686Z","2.0.1":"2023-07-29T19:40:01.088Z","2.1.0":"2023-08-25T21:32:59.269Z","2.2.0":"2024-01-14T03:47:05.980Z","2.3.0":"2024-06-13T03:49:36.778Z","3.0.0":"2024-06-22T14:50:18.171Z"},"versions":{"0.22.6":{"name":"typedoc-plugin-missing-exports","version":"0.22.6","description":"Include non-exported types in TypeDoc documentation","main":"./index.js","exports":"./index.js","author":{"name":"Gerrit Birkeland"},"license":"MIT","devDependencies":{"@types/node":"^16.11.10","ava":"^3.15.0","prettier":"^2.4.1","typedoc":"^0.22.10","typescript":"^4.5.2"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/Gerrit0/typedoc-plugin-missing-exports.git"},"keywords":["typedocplugin"],"peerDependencies":{"typedoc":"0.22.x"},"scripts":{"pretest":"node scripts/copy_test_files.js","test":"ava","build":"tsc"},"ava":{"files":["test/**/*.test.js"]},"licenseText":"Copyright 2021 Gerrit Birkeland\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
