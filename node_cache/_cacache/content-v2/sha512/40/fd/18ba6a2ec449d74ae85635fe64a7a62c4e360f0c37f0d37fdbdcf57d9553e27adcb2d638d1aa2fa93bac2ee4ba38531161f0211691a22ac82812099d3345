This module attempts to work around this issue by waiting until those streams have been completely drained before actually calling `process.exit`.\n\nSee [Node.js issue #3584](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/3584) for further reference.\n\nTested in OS X 10.8, Windows 7 on Node.js 0.8.25 and 0.10.18.\n\nBased on some code by [@vladikoff](https://github.com/vladikoff).\n\n## Getting Started\nInstall the module with: `npm install exit`\n\n```javascript\nvar exit = require('exit');\n\n// These lines should appear in the output, EVEN ON WINDOWS.\nconsole.log(\"foo\");\nconsole.error(\"bar\");\n\n// process.exit(5);\nexit(5);\n\n// These lines shouldn't appear in the output.\nconsole.log(\"foo\");\nconsole.error(\"bar\");\n```\n\n## Don't believe me? Try it for yourself.\n\nIn Windows, clone the repo and cd to the `test\\fixtures` directory. The only difference between [log.js](test/fixtures/log.js) and [log-broken.js](test/fixtures/log-broken.js) is that the former uses `exit` while the latter calls `process.exit` directly.\n\n```\nC:\\node-exit\\test\\fixtures>node log.js 0 10 stdout stderr 2>&1 | find \"std\"\n[stdout] testing 0\n[stderr] testing 0\n[stdout] testing 1\n[stderr] testing 1\n[stdout] testing 2\n[stderr] testing 2\n[stdout] testing 3\n[stderr] testing 3\n[stdout] testing 4\n[stderr] testing 4\n[stdout] testing 5\n[stderr] testing 5\n[stdout] testing 6\n[stderr] testing 6\n[stdout] testing 7\n[stderr] testing 7\n[stdout] testing 8\n[stderr] testing 8\n[stdout] testing 9\n[stderr] testing 9\n\nC:\\node-exit\\test\\fixtures>node log-broken.js 0 10 stdout stderr 2>&1 | find \"std\"\n\nC:\\node-exit\\test\\fixtures>\n```\n\n## Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.
