It is a simple templating engine that accepts strings with actions embedded in them:\n\n```javascript\n\"This is {{ an_adjective }} sentence.\"\n```\n\nWhere each action returns a random string selected from a list:\n\n```javascript\n\"This is a bankrupt sentence.\"\n```\n\nThink of it as madlibs for Javascript. Want to roll your own lorem ipsum generator? `Sentencer` allows you to write the structure of your sentences and plug in any kind of vocabulary you choose.\n\n`Sentencer` was written for and powers [Metaphorpsum](http://metaphorpsum.com). The noun and adjective lists come from a relatively small curated selection of Ashley Bovan's excellent [Word Lists for Writers](http://www.ashley-bovan.co.uk/words/partsofspeech.html).\n\n### How\n\n`npm install sentencer --save`\n\n```javascript\nvar Sentencer = require('sentencer');\n\nSentencer.make(\"This sentence has {{ a_noun }} and {{ an_adjective }} {{ noun }} in it.\");\n// returns something like \"This sentence has a bat and a finless cinema in it.\"\n```\n\nHere are all of the options, described in detail below.\n\n```javascript\nvar Sentencer = require('sentencer');\n\nSentencer.configure({\n  // the list of nouns to use. Sentencer provides its own if you don't have one!\n  nounList: [],\n\n  // the list of adjectives to use. Again, Sentencer comes with one!\n  adjectiveList: [],\n\n  // additional actions for the template engine to use.\n  // you can also redefine the preset actions here if you need to.\n  // See the \"Add your own actions\" section below.\n  actions: {\n    my_action: function(){\n      return \"something\";\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Actions\n\n`Sentencer` works by recognizing \"actions\" within `{{ double_brackets }}`. It replaces these actions with strings. The default actions are `{{ noun }}`, `{{ a_noun }}`, `{{ nouns }}`, `{{ adjective }}`, and `{{ an_adjective }}`, but you can extend `Sentencer` to include any kind of actions you need!\n\nThe default actions will continue to work if you pass in new a `nounList` and/or `adjectiveList` using `Sentencer.configure`.\n\n`Sentencer`'s actions are written semantically so that your sentence template still reads as a sentence. While this was simply a design decision, it does make templates easier to read and you are encouraged to follow this format if you create custom actions.\n\n#### `\"{{ noun }}\"`\n\nReturns a random noun from the noun list.\n\n```javascript\nvar noun = Sentencer.make(\"{{ noun }}\")\n// \"actor\", \"knight\", \"orchid\", \"pizza\", etc.\n```\n\n#### `\"{{ a_noun }}\"`\n\nReturns a random noun from the noun list with \"a\" or \"an\" in front of it.\n\n```javascript\nvar nounWithArticle = Sentencer.make(\"{{ a_noun }}\")\n// \"an actor\", \"a knight\", \"an orchid\", \"a pizza\", etc.\n```\n\n#### `\"{{ nouns }}\"`\n\nReturns the pluralized form of a random noun from the noun list. It's not 100% perfect, but it's probably 97% perfect.\n\n```javascript\nvar pluralNoun = Sentencer.make(\"{{ nouns }}\")\n// \"actors\", \"knights\", \"orchids\", \"pizzas\", etc.\n```\n\n#### `\"{{ adjective }}\"`\n\nReturns a random adjective from the adjective list.\n\n```javascript\nvar adjective = Sentencer.make(\"{{ adjective }}\")\n// \"blending\", \"earthy\", \"rugged\", \"untamed\", etc.\n```\n\n#### `\"{{ an_adjective }}\"`\n\nReturns a random adjective from the adjective list with \"a\" or \"an\" in front of it.\n\n```javascript\nvar adjective = Sentencer.make(\"{{ an_adjective }}\")\n// \"a blending\", \"an earthy\", \"a rugged\", \"an untamed\", etc.\n```\n\n### Add your own actions\n\nWhen configuring `Sentencer` you can provide your own \"actions\", which are just functions that return something. The name of the function that you pass into `actions` is how you will reference it within a sentence template.\n\nHere's an example of an action that returns a random number from 1 to 10.\n\n```javascript\nvar Sentencer = require('sentencer');\n\nSentencer.configure({\n  actions: {\n    number: function() {\n      return Math.floor( Math.random() * 10 ) + 1;\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nconsole.log( Sentencer.make(\"I can count to {{ number }}.\")\n// \"I can count to 5.\"\n```\n\n#### Actions can take arguments\n\nYou can pass arguments into your actions. We can use this to make a smarter version of the random number generator above...\n\n```javascript\nvar Sentencer = require('sentencer');\n\nSentencer.configure({\n  actions: {\n    number: function(min, max) {\n      return Math.floor( Math.random() * (max - min) ) + min;\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nconsole.log( Sentencer.make(\"I can count to {{ number(8, 10) }}.\")\n// \"I can count to 8.\"\n```\n\nA technical note: if `Sentencer` finds that you have provided arguments to your action it will use `eval` in order to call it. It will `try`/`catch` this in case it fails, but one definite limitation is that your action can't contain characters that would force you to use `object[\"property\"]` notation. For example, `\"{{ my-custom-action(3) }}\"` would fail, whereas `\"{{ my_custom_action(3) }}\"` would succeed.\n\n### Where are the verbs?\n\nVerb pluralization, singularization, and tense modification are difficult computer science problems. `Sentencer` doesn't aim to solve those problems, however _present tense_ verb pluralization/singularization is an experimental feature of [`natural`](https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural) and could be integrated if necessary.\n\n-----------\n\n`Sentencer` was created and is maintained by [Kyle Stetz](https://github.com/kylestetz). The original prototype came out of [Metaphorpsum](https://github.com/kylestetz/metaphorpsum) but has been rewritten from the ground up.","time":{"created":"2022-01-26T20:57:49.947Z","modified":"2022-01-26T20:57:49.947Z","0.2.1":"2020-03-26T13:12:36.160Z","0.2.0":"2019-03-08T15:04:54.932Z","0.1.5":"2015-12-22T16:33:19.963Z","0.1.4":"2015-02-08T05:10:41.299Z","0.1.3":"2015-02-08T04:00:51.863Z","0.1.2":"2015-02-08T03:56:41.340Z","0.1.1":"2014-10-11T18:42:13.328Z"},"versions":{"0.2.1":{"name":"sentencer","version":"0.2.1","description":"Sentencer
