// true\nreserved.check('volatile', 'es2015'); // false\nreserved.check('yield', 3); // false\nreserved.check('yield', 6); // true\n```\n\n### dialects\n\n#### es3 (or 3)\n\nRepresents [ECMA-262 3rd edition](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-ARCH/ECMA-262,%203rd%20edition,%20December%201999.pdf).\n\nSee section 7.5.1.\n\n#### es5 (or 5)\n\nRepresents [ECMA-262 5th edition (ECMAScript 5.1)](http://es5.github.io/).\n\nReserved Words are formally defined in ECMA262 sections\n[7.6.1.1](http://es5.github.io/#x7.6.1.1) and [7.6.1.2](http://es5.github.io/#x7.6.1.2).\n\n#### es2015 (or es6, 6)\n\nRepresents [ECMA-262 6th edition](ECMAScript 2015).\n\nReserved Words are formally defined in sections\n[11.6.2.1](http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-keywords) and\n[11.6.2.2](http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-future-reserved-words).\n\n### License\n\nLicensed under [The MIT License](https://github.com/zxqfox/reserved-words/blob/master/LICENSE)\n","time":{"created":"2022-01-26T12:55:48.894Z","modified":"2023-07-28T09:50:05.764Z","0.1.2":"2017-08-12T13:30:48.769Z","0.1.1":"2015-07-20T10:51:23.955Z"},"versions":{"0.1.2":{"name":"reserved-words","version":"0.1.2","description":"ECMAScript reserved words checker","main":"lib/index.js","scripts":{"test":"jshint && jscs lib test && mocha"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/zxqfox/reserved-words.git"},"keywords":["ES3","ES5","ES6","ReservedWord","Keyword","checker"],"author":{"name":"Alexej Yaroshevich","email":"zxqfox@gmail.com","url":"http://github.com/zxqfox"},"license":"MIT","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/zxqfox/reserved-words/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/zxqfox/reserved-words#readme","devDependencies":{"jscs":"^1.13.1","jscs-jsdoc":"^1.1.0","jshint":"^2.8.0","mocha":"^2.2.5"},"files":["lib","README.md","LICENSE"],"gitHead":"55071b49b55e57b949b0557b4e8f2b711919fe43","_id":"reserved-words@0.1.2","_shasum":"00a0940f98cd501aeaaac316411d9adc52b31ab1","_from":".","_npmVersion":"2.15.11","_nodeVersion":"4.5.0","_npmUser":{"name":"qfox","email":"zxqfox@gmail.com"},"dist":{"shasum":"00a0940f98cd501aeaaac316411d9adc52b31ab1","size":4055,"noattachment":false,"tarball":"https://registry.npmmirror.com/reserved-words/-/reserved-words-0.1.2.tgz","integrity":"sha512-0S5SrIUJ9LfpbVl4Yzij6VipUdafHrOTzvmfazSw/jeZrZtQK303OPZW+obtkaw7jQlTQppy0UvZWm9872PbRw=="},"maintainers":[{"name":"qfox","email":"zxqfox@gmail.com"}],"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/reserved-words-0.1.2.tgz_1502544647834_0.17254906753078103"},"directories":{},"publish_time":1502544648769,"_hasShrinkwrap":false,"_cnpm_publish_time":1502544648769,"_cnpmcore_publish_time":"2021-12-13T16:37:22.221Z"},"0.1.1":{"name":"reserved-words","version":"0.1.1","description":"ECMAScript reserved words checker","main":"lib/index.js","scripts":{"test":"jshint && jscs lib test && mocha"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/zxqfox/reserved-words.git"},"keywords":["ES3","ES5","ES6","ReservedWord","Keyword","checker"],"author":{"name":"Alexej Yaroshevich","email":"zxqfox@gmail.com","url":"http://github.com/zxqfox"},"license":"MIT","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/zxqfox/reserved-words/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/zxqfox/reserved-words#readme","devDependencies":{"jscs":"^1.13.1","jscs-jsdoc":"^1.1.0","jshint":"^2.8.0","mocha":"^2.2.5"},"files":["lib","README.md","LICENSE"],"gitHead":"0f719a971be6cfbe582d3d11a86726470904d5e1","_id":"reserved-words@0.1.1","_shasum":"6f7c15e5e5614c50da961630da46addc87c0cef2","_from":".","_npmVersion":"2.9.0","_nodeVersion":"2.0.1","_npmUser":{"name":"qfox","email":"zxqfox@gmail.com"},"dist":{"shasum":"6f7c15e5e5614c50da961630da46addc87c0cef2","size":3280,"noattachment":false,"tarball":"https://registry.npmmirror.com/reserved-words/-/reserved-words-0.1.1.tgz","integrity":"sha512-euEybI59Vm1AF89RoZ3CloQB77LnIdRnJQRGOWqQxuFC8Brd0DVSoxfDt/+k+MTT6VcCK5aqwkcRG+kZp7uAIg=="},"maintainers":[{"name":"qfox","email":"zxqfox@gmail.com"}],"directories":{},"publish_time":1437389483955,"_hasShrinkwrap":false,"_cnpm_publish_time":1437389483955,"_cnpmcore_publish_time":"2021-12-13T16:37:22.459Z"}},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/zxqfox/reserved-words/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/zxqfox/reserved-words#readme","keywords":["ES3","ES5","ES6","ReservedWord","Keyword","checker"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/zxqfox/reserved-words.git"},"_source_registry_name":"default"}
