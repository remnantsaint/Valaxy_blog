Mainly for semi-backwards compatibility with npm-which 1.0.0.\n\n```js\nwhich('tape', {cwd: '/some/other/path'}, function() {\n  // ...\n})\n```\n\n### Command Line\n\n```bash\n> npm-which tape\n/Users/timoxley/Projects/npm-which/node_modules/.bin/tape\n```\n\nThis is the equivalent of running an npm script with the body: `which tape`.\n\n### Example\n\n```bash\n# unless something is installed in a node_modules\n# npm-which and which(1) will have the same output:\n\n> which tape\n/usr/local/bin/tape\n\n> npm-which tape\n/usr/local/bin/tape\n\n# install tape local to current dir\n# tape includes an executable 'tape'\n> npm install tape\n> ./node_modules/.bin/tape && echo 'found'\nfound\n\n# vanilla which(1) still finds global tape\n> which tape\n/usr/local/bin/tape\n\n# npm-which finds locally installed tape :)\n> npm-which tape\n/Users/timoxley/Projects/npm-which/node_modules/.bin/tape\n```\n\n## Why\n\n#### npm is slow to boot\n\n* Shelling out to `npm bin` is very slow; it has to wait for all of npm to boot up â€“ this often takes longer than the actual script you want to execute!\n\n#### Hard-coding paths to modules is very fragile\n\n* You can't rely on './node_modules' actually containing your module! The module may exist much higher in the directory hierarchy.\n* `npm bin` returns the location of the `./node_modules/.bin` directory, but it does not take into account being called within the context of another module, also, npm slow.\n* If the module does exist in a parent directory, then './node_modules/.bin' will be missing your module's executable.\n\n##
