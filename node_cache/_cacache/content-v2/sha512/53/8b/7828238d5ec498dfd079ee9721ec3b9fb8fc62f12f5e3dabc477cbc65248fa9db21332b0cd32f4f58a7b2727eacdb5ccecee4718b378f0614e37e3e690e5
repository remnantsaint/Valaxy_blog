This package displays a beginner-friendly message if their Node version is below the one expected.\n\n```sh\n$ node -v\n0.12\n\n$ modern-cli\nmodern-cli requires at least version 6 of Node, please upgrade\n```\n\n## Support\n\nIf you like this project, you can support me on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/users/typicode/sponsorship)\n\n## Usage\n\n```sh\nnpm install please-upgrade-node\n```\n\nAdd `please-upgrade-node` at the top of your CLI\n\n```js\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nconst pkg = require('./package.json')\nrequire('please-upgrade-node')(pkg) // <- Must run BEFORE requiring any other modules\n\n// ...\n```\n\nSet in your `package.json` the required Node version\n\n```js\n{\n  \"engines\": {\n    \"node\": \">=6\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n__Important__: `>=` is the only operator supported by `please-upgrade-node` (e.g. `>=6`, `>=6.0`, `>=6.0.0`).\n\n## Options\n\nYou can set custom `exitCode` and `message` function if needed\n\n```js\npleaseUpgradeNode(pkg, {\n  exitCode: 0, // Default: 1\n  message: function(requiredVersion) {\n    return 'Oops this program require Node ' +  requiredVersion\n  }\n})\n```\n\n__Important__: to keep `message` function compatible with older versions of Node, avoid using ES6 features like `=>` or string interpolation.\n\n## See also\n\n* [pkg-ok](https://github.com/typicode/pkg-ok) - :ok_hand: Prevents publishing a
