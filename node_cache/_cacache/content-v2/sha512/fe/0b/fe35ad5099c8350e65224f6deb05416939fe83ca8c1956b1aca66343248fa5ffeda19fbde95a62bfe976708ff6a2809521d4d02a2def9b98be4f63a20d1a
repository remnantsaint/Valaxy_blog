It's not\nclear what the best merged list is, but it's probably either `[2, 1, 3]` or\n`[1, 3, 2]`.\n\nIn general, it's not totally clear what the \"best\" merged list is, but there are\nsome basic properties that anyone would expect:\n\n- Since the order of list1 is preserved, the merged list will look like the\n  first list with the elements exclusive to the second inserted in betweeen\n- If `list2[i]` is not in `list1`, and it is possible to insert `list2[i]` into\n  `list1` without contradicting the order of `list2`, then it should be inserted\n  in such a way\n\nThis tool is very slow, crossing the 100ms mark with lists around 150 in length,\nand growing at a rate of\n`O(list2.length*list2.length*(list1.length + list2.length))` from there.\n\n\nInstallation / Usage\n--------------------\n\nInstall with\n\n```\nnpm install combine-lists\n```\n\nUse like so:\n\n```js\nvar combineLists = require('combine-lists');\ncombineLists([1, 2], [2, 3]); // [1, 2, 3]\n```\n","time":{"created":"2022-01-26T15:07:46.700Z","modified":"2023-05-12T18:22:05.659Z","1.0.1":"2016-09-07T14:18:12.607Z","1.0.0":"2016-02-19T22:56:13.275Z"},"versions":{"1.0.1":{"name":"combine-lists","version":"1.0.1","description":"Merge two lists, trying to preserve the order of both ","main":"index.js","scripts":{"test":"node node_modules/.bin/jasmine JASMINE_CONFIG_PATH=test/config.json"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/sjelin/combine-lists.git"},"keywords":["utility","array","list","merge","combine","topological","sort"],"author":{"name":"sjelin"},"license":"MIT","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/sjelin/combine-lists/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/sjelin/combine-lists#readme","dependencies":{"lodash":"^4.5.0"},"devDependencies":{"jasmine":"^2.4.1","seedrandom":"^2.4.2"},"gitHead":"ae52afa4b79bc4802a14af8914745ac0e3a77d51","_id":"combine-lists@1.0.1","_shasum":"458c07e09e0d900fc28b70a3fec2dacd1d2cb7f6","_from":".","_npmVersion":"3.7.2","_nodeVersion":"4.0.0","_npmUser":{"name":"sjelin","email":"sjelin@gmail.com"},"dist":{"shasum":"458c07e09e0d900fc28b70a3fec2dacd1d2cb7f6","size":3062,"noattachment":false,"tarball":"https://registry.npmmirror.com/combine-lists/-/combine-lists-1.0.1.tgz","integrity":"sha512-4Mi0V7N48B9KzC8Zl/U7wiWuxMFEHf44N3/PSoAvWDu8IOPrddNo1y1tC/kXbP7IvVMhgCFMMNzgKb0pWoin9w=="},"maintainers":[{"name":"sjelin","email":"sjelin@gmail.com"}],"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/combine-lists-1.0.1.tgz_1473257890976_0.5467275755945593"},"directories":{},"publish_time":1473257892607,"_hasShrinkwrap":false,"_cnpm_publish_time":1473257892607,"_cnpmcore_publish_time":"2021-12-13T16:28:29.690Z"},"1.0.0":{"name":"combine-lists","version":"1.0.0","description":"Merge two lists, trying to preserve the order of both ","main":"index.js","scripts":{"test":"node node_modules/.bin/jasmine JASMINE_CONFIG_PATH=test/config.json"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/sjelin/combine-lists.git"},"keywords":["utility","array","list","merge","combine","topological","sort"],"author":{"name":"sjelin"},"license":"MIT","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/sjelin/combine-lists/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/sjelin/combine-lists#readme","dependencies":{"lodash":"^4.5.0"},"devDependencies":{"jasmine":"^2.4.1","seedrandom":"^2.4.2"},"gitHead":"8ae9086d9f648ebb54911ede08e750b55f8a4d0a","_id":"combine-lists@1.0.0","_shasum":"e55dee53e5584f232eb59aeb16a7e66c338b5d06","_from":".","_npmVersion":"1.4.28","_npmUser":{"name":"sjelin","email":"sjelin@gmail.com"},"maintainers":[{"name":"sjelin","email":"sjelin@gmail.com"}],"dist":{"shasum":"e55dee53e5584f232eb59aeb16a7e66c338b5d06","size":2366,"noattachment":false,"tarball":"https://registry.npmmirror.com/combine-lists/-/combine-lists-1.0.0.tgz","integrity":"sha512-PSj3mIWKZwMEzQIOMORv/xkY7f0/k4TQrmhc6ZJ7U0Xl0DcMTJGNPkzowZ0bmPWdJw5tevQJEUqubpoqn9CFEw=="},"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-6-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/combine-lists-1.0.0.tgz_1455922568744_0.7149797205347568"},"directories":{},"publish_time":1455922573275,"_hasShrinkwrap":false,"_cnpm_publish_time":1455922573275,"_cnpmcore_publish_time":"2021-12-13T16:28:29.911Z"}},"_source_registry_name":"default"}
