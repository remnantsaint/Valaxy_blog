The `lastLine` value will grow until the stream sees a newline character (`'\\n'`).\n\n## Low Level API\n\nA low-level non-stream based API is available. It has only two methods.\n\n```js\nvar createTracker = require('last-line-stream/tracker');\nvar tracker = createTracker();\n\n// append some text.\ntracker.update(someString);\n\n// Find the complete last line of all the text appended.\ntracker.lastLine();\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT Â© [James Talmage](http://github.com/jamestalmage)\n","time":{"created":"2022-01-26T20:21:02.444Z","modified":"2023-07-03T18:43:44.729Z","1.0.0":"2016-01-12T22:07:29.305Z","0.1.0":"2016-01-11T02:29:25.219Z"},"versions":{"1.0.0":{"name":"last-line-stream","version":"1.0.0","description":"A PassThrough stream that keeps track of last line written","license":"MIT","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/jamestalmage/last-line-stream.git"},"author":{"name":"James Talmage","email":"james@talmage.io","url":"github.com/jamestalmage"},"engines":{"node":">=0.10.0"},"scripts":{"test":"xo && nyc --reporter=lcov --reporter=text --cache ava"},"files":["index.js","tracker.js"],"keywords":["stream","streams","line","lines","newline","spy","last","passthrough","pass-through","pass","through"],"dependencies":{"through2":"^2.0.0"},"devDependencies":{"ava":"^0.9.1","coveralls":"^2.11.6","nyc":"^5.3.0","xo":"^0.12.1"},"gitHead":"5be872f541028fb79dbabd28bfa5777a01514854","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jamestalmage/last-line-stream/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jamestalmage/last-line-stream#readme","_id":"last-line-stream@1.0.0","_shasum":"d1b64d69f86ff24af2d04883a2ceee14520a5600","_from":".","_npmVersion":"3.5.3","_nodeVersion":"5.3.0","_npmUser":{"name":"jamestalmage","email":"james@talmage.io"},"dist":{"shasum":"d1b64d69f86ff24af2d04883a2ceee14520a5600","size":2223,"noattachment":false,"tarball":"https://registry.npmmirror.com/last-line-stream/-/last-line-stream-1.0.0.tgz","integrity":"sha512-A9su/wrZOLGwo27plXO4hCBttJx9JvALtnmq4UFe9KCAFHuk1rZFuVv+4AXlBAnb/ex7IKf81Tfo32hXDhQuxg=="},"maintainers":[{"name":"jamestalmage","email":"james@talmage.io"}],"directories":{},"publish_time":1452636449305,"_hasShrinkwrap":false,"_cnpm_publish_time":1452636449305,"_cnpmcore_publish_time":"2021-12-16T15:32:04.036Z"},"0.1.0":{"name":"last-line-stream","version":"0.1.0","description":"A PassThrough stream that keeps track of last line written","license":"MIT","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/jamestalmage/last-line-stream.git"},"author":{"name":"James Talmage","email":"james@talmage.io","url":"github.com/jamestalmage"},"engines":{"node":">=0.10.0"},"scripts":{"test":"xo && nyc --reporter=lcov --reporter=text --cache ava"},"files":["index.js"],"keywords":["stream","streams","line","lines","newline","spy","last","passthrough","pass-through","pass","through"],"dependencies":{"through2":"^2.0.0"},"devDependencies":{"ava":"^0.9.1","coveralls":"^2.11.6","nyc":"^5.3.0","xo":"^0.12.1"},"gitHead":"6dfdfff90de04bd081c7e7763a8eaa693b3dd1e3","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jamestalmage/last-line-stream/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jamestalmage/last-line-stream#readme","_id":"last-line-stream@0.1.0","_shasum":"40d7ec63085734819216771a9daa11e34563e6df","_from":".","_npmVersion":"3.5.3","_nodeVersion":"5.3.0","_npmUser":{"name":"jamestalmage","email":"james@talmage.io"},"dist":{"shasum":"40d7ec63085734819216771a9daa11e34563e6df","size":1988,"noattachment":false,"tarball":"https://registry.npmmirror.com/last-line-stream/-/last-line-stream-0.1.0.tgz","integrity":"sha512-lyY7KSU2rhBnIOeDdBGXMFfieZcyM0DqiKbcMGmO08jFs6ssUP1jrDBgX2/eUl9Er2HT5z8DW/BdBzLlbl4aew=="},"maintainers":[{"name":"jamestalmage","email":"james@talmage.io"}],"directories":{},"publish_time":1452479365219,"_hasShrinkwrap":false,"_cnpm_publish_time":1452479365219,"_cnpmcore_publish_time":"2021-12-16T15:32:04.429Z"}},"_source_registry_name":"default"}
