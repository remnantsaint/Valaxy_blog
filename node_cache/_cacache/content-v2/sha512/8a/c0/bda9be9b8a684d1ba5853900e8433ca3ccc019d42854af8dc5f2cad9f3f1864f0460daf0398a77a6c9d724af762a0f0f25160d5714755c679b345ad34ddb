Uses [terser](https://github.com/fabiosantoscode/terser) under the hood.\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\nyarn add rollup-plugin-terser --dev\n# Or with npm:\nnpm i rollup-plugin-terser --save-dev\n```\n\n_Note: this package requires rollup@0.66 and higher (including rollup@2.0.0)_\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nimport { rollup } from \"rollup\";\nimport { terser } from \"rollup-plugin-terser\";\n\nrollup({\n  input: \"main.js\",\n  plugins: [terser()],\n});\n```\n\n## Why named export?\n\n1. Module is a namespace. Default export often leads to function/component per file dogma and makes code less maintainable.\n2. Interop with commonjs is broken in many cases or hard to maintain.\n3. Show me any good language with default exports. It's historical javascriptism.\n\n## Options\n\n> ⚠️ **Caveat:** any function used in options object cannot rely on its surrounding scope, since it is executed in an isolated context.\n\n```js\nterser(options);\n```\n\n`options` - [terser API options](https://github.com/fabiosantoscode/terser#minify-options)\n\nNote: some terser options are set by the plugin automatically:\n\n- `module: true` is set when `format` is `esm` or `es`\n- `toplevel: true` is set when `format` is `cjs`\n\n`options.numWorkers: number`\n\nAmount of workers to spawn. Defaults to the number of CPUs minus 1.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Using as output plugin\n\n```js\n// rollup.config.js\nimport { terser } from \"rollup-plugin-terser\";\n\nexport default {\n  input: \"index.js\",\n  output: [\n    { file: \"lib.js\", format: \"cjs\" },\n    { file: \"lib.min.js\", format: \"cjs\", plugins: [terser()] },\n    { file: \"lib.esm.js\", format: \"esm\" },\n  ],\n};\n```\n\n### Comments\n\nIf you'd like to preserve comments (for licensing for example), then you can specify a function to do this like so:\n\n```js\nterser({\n  output: {\n    comments: function (node, comment) {\n      var text = comment.value;\n      var type = comment.type;\n      if (type == \"comment2\") {\n        // multiline comment\n        return /@preserve|@license|@cc_on/i.test(text);\n      }\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can also choose to keep all comments (e.g. if a licensing header has already been prepended by a previous rollup plugin):\n\n```js\nterser({\n  output: {\n    comments: \"all\",\n  },\n});\n```\n\nSee [Terser documentation](https://github.com/fabiosantoscode/terser#terser) for further reference.\n\n# License\n\nMIT © [Bogdan Chadkin](mailto:trysound@yandex.ru)\n","time":{"created":"2022-01-26T12:52:59.747Z","modified":"2024-02-29T23:17:34.646Z","7.0.2":"2020-09-04T18:39:17.900Z","5.3.1":"2020-09-04T15:04:54.989Z","7.0.1":"2020-08-28T19:19:34.925Z","7.0.0":"2020-08-09T12:44:33.522Z","6.1.0":"2020-05-24T21:58:21.233Z","6.0.1":"2020-05-23T11:13:05.576Z","6.0.0":"2020-05-23T10:07:40.141Z","5.3.0":"2020-03-09T19:28:16.236Z","5.2.0":"2020-01-11T11:25:45.301Z","5.1.3":"2019-12-11T10:10:14.865Z","5.1.2":"2019-09-12T08:22:59.830Z","5.1.1":"2019-07-07T07:16:56.609Z","5.1.0":"2019-07-02T19:12:23.759Z","5.0.0":"2019-05-21T19:14:07.247Z","4.0.4":"2019-02-05T09:10:00.556Z","4.0.3":"2019-01-25T18:02:25.774Z","4.0.2":"2019-01-08T20:30:24.529Z","4.0.1":"2019-01-02T16:10:37.240Z","4.0.0":"2019-01-01T21:25:00.709Z","3.0.0":"2018-09-16T14:23:46.841Z","2.0.2":"2018-08-30T22:07:48.818Z","2.0.1":"2018-08-30T19:33:33.537Z","2.0.0":"2018-08-30T19:17:28.569Z","1.0.1":"2018-05-19T08:32:49.989Z","1.0.0":"2018-05-17T14:57:53.654Z"},"versions":{"7.0.2":{"name":"rollup-plugin-terser","version":"7.0.2","description":"Rollup plugin to minify generated es bundle","type":"commonjs","main":"rollup-plugin-terser.js","types":"rollup-plugin-terser.d.ts","exports":{"require":"./rollup-plugin-terser.js","import":"./rollup-plugin-terser.mjs"},"scripts":{"test":"jest","prepublish":"yarn test"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/TrySound/rollup-plugin-terser.git"},"keywords":["rollup","rollup-plugin","terser","minify"],"author":{"name":"Bogdan Chadkin","email":"trysound@yandex.ru"},"license":"MIT","dependencies":{"@babel/code-frame":"^7.10.4","jest-worker":"^26.2.1","serialize-javascript":"^4.0.0","terser":"^5.0.0"},"peerDependencies":{"rollup":"^2.0.0"},"devDependencies":{"@babel/core":"^7.11.1","jest":"^26.2.2","prettier":"^2.0.5","rollup":"^2.23.1"},"licenseText":"The MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright 2018 Bogdan Chadkin <trysound@yandex.ru>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
