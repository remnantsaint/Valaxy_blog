[Compatibility](#compatibility)\n* [Contribute](#contribute)\n* [License](#license)\n\n## What is this?\n\nThis package checks file names.\n\n## When should I use this?\n\nYou can use this package to check that file names are consistent.\n\n## Presets\n\nThis plugin is included in the following presets:\n\n| Preset | Options |\n| - | - |\n| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) | |\n\n## Install\n\nThis package is [ESM only][github-gist-esm].\nIn Node.js (version 16+),\ninstall with [npm][npm-install]:\n\n```sh\nnpm install remark-lint-no-file-name-consecutive-dashes\n```\n\nIn Deno with [`esm.sh`][esm-sh]:\n\n```js\nimport remarkLintNoFileNameConsecutiveDashes from 'https://esm.sh/remark-lint-no-file-name-consecutive-dashes@3'\n```\n\nIn browsers with [`esm.sh`][esm-sh]:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\">\n  import remarkLintNoFileNameConsecutiveDashes from 'https://esm.sh/remark-lint-no-file-name-consecutive-dashes@3?bundle'\n</script>\n```\n\n## Use\n\nOn the API:\n\n```js\nimport remarkLint from 'remark-lint'\nimport remarkLintNoFileNameConsecutiveDashes from 'remark-lint-no-file-name-consecutive-dashes'\nimport remarkParse from 'remark-parse'\nimport remarkStringify from 'remark-stringify'\nimport {read} from 'to-vfile'\nimport {unified} from 'unified'\nimport {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'\n\nconst file = await read('example.md')\n\nawait unified()\n  .use(remarkParse)\n  .use(remarkLint)\n  .use(remarkLintNoFileNameConsecutiveDashes)\n  .use(remarkStringify)\n  .process(file)\n\nconsole.error(reporter(file))\n```\n\nOn the CLI:\n\n```sh\nremark --frail --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-no-file-name-consecutive-dashes .\n```\n\nOn the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):\n\n```diff\n …\n \"remarkConfig\": {\n   \"plugins\": [\n     …\n     \"remark-lint\",\n+    \"remark-lint-no-file-name-consecutive-dashes\",\n     …\n   ]\n }\n …\n```\n\n## API\n\nThis package exports no identifiers.\nIt exports no additional [TypeScript][typescript] types.\nThe default export is\n[`remarkLintNoFileNameConsecutiveDashes`][api-remark-lint-no-file-name-consecutive-dashes].\n\n### `unified().use(remarkLintNoFileNameConsecutiveDashes)`\n\nWarn when file names contain consecutive dashes.\n\n###### Parameters\n\nThere are no options.\n\n###### Returns\n\nTransform ([`Transformer` from `unified`][github-unified-transformer]).\n\n## Examples\n\n##### `plug-ins.md`\n\n###### Out\n\nNo messages.\n\n##### `plug--ins.md`\n\n###### Out\n\n```text\n1:1: Unexpected consecutive dashes in a file name, expected `-`\n```\n\n## Compatibility\n\nProjects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained\nversions of Node.js.\n\nWhen we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of\nNode.\nThis means we try to keep the current release line,\n`remark-lint-no-file-name-consecutive-dashes@3`,\ncompatible with Node.js 16.\n\n## Contribute\n\nSee [`contributing.md`][github-dotfiles-contributing] in
