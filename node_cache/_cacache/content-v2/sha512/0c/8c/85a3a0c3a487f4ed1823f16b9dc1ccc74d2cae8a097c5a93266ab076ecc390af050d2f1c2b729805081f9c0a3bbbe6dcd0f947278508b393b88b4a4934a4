--save base-runtimes\n```\n\nThis plugin is a basic wrapper for [composer-runtimes](https://github.com/doowb/composer-runtimes) and [composer](https://github.com/doowb/composer), see those libraries to learn more about available features and options, or to report issues related to runtimes colors or formatting.\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar runtimes = require('base-runtimes');\nvar task = require('base-tasks');\nvar Base = require('base');\nvar app = new Base();\n\n// register plugins\napp.use(task());\napp.use(runtimes());\n\napp.task('default', function(cb) {\n  cb();\n});\n\n// run the `default` task\napp.build(function(err) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n});\n```\n\nWith `runtimes` registed, you should see something like the following when `.build` is called:\n\n<img width=\"363\"
