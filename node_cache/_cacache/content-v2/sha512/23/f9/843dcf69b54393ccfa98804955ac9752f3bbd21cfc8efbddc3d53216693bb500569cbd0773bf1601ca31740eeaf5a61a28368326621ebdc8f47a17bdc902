If you're interested in helping with the TSLint/ESLint migration, please check out our [OSS Fellowship](https://medium.com/palantir/fellowships-for-open-source-developers-3892e6b75ee1) program.\n\nTSLint is an extensible static analysis tool that checks [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) code for readability, maintainability, and functionality errors. It is widely supported across modern editors & build systems and can be customized with your own lint rules, configurations, and formatters.\n\nTSLint currently supports:\n\n-   an extensive set of core rules\n-   custom lint rules\n-   custom formatters (failure reporters)\n-   inline disabling and enabling of rules with comment flags in source code\n-   configuration presets (`tslint:latest`, `tslint-react`, etc.) and plugin composition\n-   automatic fixing of formatting & style violations\n-   integration with [MSBuild](https://github.com/joshuakgoldberg/tslint.msbuild), [Grunt](https://github.com/palantir/grunt-tslint), [Gulp](https://github.com/panuhorsmalahti/gulp-tslint), [Atom](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-tslint), [Eclipse](https://github.com/palantir/eclipse-tslint), [Emacs](https://www.flycheck.org/), [Sublime](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-contrib-tslint), [Vim](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic), [Visual Studio 2015](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.WebAnalyzer), [Visual Studio 2017](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RichNewman.TypeScriptAnalyzer), [Visual Studio code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin) (alternative: use [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint) for TS <3.2), [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/help/tslint.html) and [more](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/third-party-tools/)\n\n## Installation & Usage\n\nPlease refer to the full installation & usage documentation on the [TSLint website](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/). There, you'll find information about\n\n-   [configuration](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/configuration/),\n-   [core rules](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/rules/),\n-   [core formatters](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/formatters/), and\n-   [customization of TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/develop/custom-rules/).\n-   [inline disabling and enabling of rules with comment flags](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/rule-flags/)\n\n## TSLint Playground\n\nThere is a sandbox environment for TSLint at [palantir.github.io/tslint-playground](https://palantir.github.io/tslint-playground/), which can be used to test rules and see how TSLint works. Issues can be filed against `tslint-playground` [here](https://github.com/palantir/tslint-playground).\n\n## Custom Rules & Plugins\n\n#### Custom rule sets from Palantir\n\n-   [tslint-react](https://github.com/palantir/tslint-react) - Lint rules related to React & JSX.\n-   [tslint-blueprint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint-blueprint) - Lint rules to enforce best practices with [blueprintjs libraries](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint)\n\n#### Custom rule sets from the community\n\nIf we don't have all the rules you're looking for, you can either write your own [custom rules](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/develop/custom-rules/) or use rules implementations developed by the community. The repos below are a good source of custom rules:\n\n-   [ESLint rules for TSLint](https://github.com/buzinas/tslint-eslint-rules) - Improve your TSLint with the missing ESLint Rules\n-   [tslint-microsoft-contrib](https://github.com/Microsoft/tslint-microsoft-contrib) - A set of TSLint rules used on some Microsoft projects\n-   [codelyzer](https://github.com/mgechev/codelyzer) - A set of tslint rules for static code analysis of Angular TypeScript projects\n-   [vrsource-tslint-rules](https://github.com/vrsource/vrsource-tslint-rules)\n-   [tslint-immutable](https://github.com/jonaskello/tslint-immutable) - TSLint rules to disable mutation in TypeScript\n-   [tslint-consistent-codestyle](https://github.com/ajafff/tslint-consistent-codestyle) - TSLint rules to enforce consistent code style in TypeScript\n-   [tslint-sonarts](https://github.com/SonarSource/SonarTS) - Bug-finding rules based on advanced code models to spot hard to find errors in TypeScript\n-   [tslint-clean-code](https://github.com/Glavin001/tslint-clean-code) - A set of TSLint rules inspired by the Clean Code handbook\n-   [rxjs-tslint-rules](https://github.com/cartant/rxjs-tslint-rules) - TSLint rules for RxJS\n\n## Development\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n-   `node` v7+\n-   `yarn` v1.0+\n\n#### Quick Start\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:palantir/tslint.git --config core.autocrlf=input

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
