Optionally, the `config-index` (zero-based) setting can be used to select a specific configuration.\n\n```yaml\n---\nsettings:\n  import/resolver: webpack  # take all defaults\n```\n\nor with explicit config file name:\n\n```yaml\n---\nsettings:\n  import/resolver:\n    webpack:\n      config: 'webpack.dev.config.js'\n```\n\nor with explicit config file index:\n\n```yaml\n---\nsettings:\n  import/resolver:\n    webpack:\n      config: 'webpack.multiple.config.js'\n      config-index: 1   # take the config at index 1\n```\n\nor with explicit config file path relative to your projects's working directory:\n\n```yaml\n---\nsettings:\n  import/resolver:\n    webpack:\n      config: './configs/webpack.dev.config.js'\n```\n\nor with explicit config object:\n\n```yaml\n---\nsettings:\n  import/resolver:\n    webpack:\n      config:\n        resolve:\n          extensions:\n            - .js\n            - .jsx\n```\n\nIf your config relies on [environment variables](https://webpack.js.org/guides/environment-variables/), they can be specified using the `env` parameter.  If your config is a function, it will be invoked with the value assigned to `env`:\n\n```yaml\n---\nsettings:\n  import/resolver:\n    webpack:\n      config: 'webpack.config.js'\n      env:\n        NODE_ENV: 'local'\n        production: true\n```\n\n## Support\n\n[Get supported eslint-import-resolver-webpack with the Tidelift Subscription](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/npm-eslint-import-resolver-webpack?utm_source=npm-eslint-import-resolver-webpack&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme)\n","time":{"created":"2022-01-26T14:30:22.648Z","modified":"2024-09-03T06:41:23.333Z","0.13.2":"2021-10-20T07:05:32.862Z","0.13.1":"2021-05-14T06:05:11.782Z","0.13.0":"2020-09-27T23:06:19.532Z","0.12.2":"2020-06-16T17:26:27.654Z","0.12.1":"2020-01-11T07:03:15.977Z","0.12.0":"2019-12-08T07:50:18.672Z","0.11.1":"2019-04-13T07:18:14.208Z","0.11.0":"2019-01-22T11:59:06.514Z","0.10.1":"2018-06-24T16:37:04.037Z","0.10.0":"2018-05-17T11:05:08.094Z","0.9.0":"2018-03-30T10:41:53.009Z","0.8.4":"2018-01-05T09:25:11.512Z","0.8.3":"2017-06-23T10:15:22.145Z","0.8.2":"2017-06-22T10:28:36.736Z","0.8.1":"2017-01-19T12:15:38.699Z","0.8.0":"2016-12-15T11:33:57.821Z","0.7.1":"2016-12-09T10:32:16.460Z","0.7.0":"2016-11-03T11:13:42.848Z","0.6.0":"2016-09-13T10:31:01.032Z","0.5.1":"2016-08-11T11:32:32.908Z","0.5.0":"2016-08-11T11:07:20.052Z","0.4.0":"2016-07-17T19:36:16.325Z","0.3.2":"2016-06-30T11:17:33.357Z","0.3.1":"2016-06-02T11:15:40.221Z","0.3.0":"2016-06-01T11:16:39.050Z","0.2.5":"2016-05-26T10:52:04.407Z","0.2.4":"2016-04-29T16:29:52.091Z","0.2.3":"2016-04-28T09:46:33.547Z","0.2.2":"2016-04-27T11:30:56.386Z","0.2.1":"2016-04-25T18:30:05.596Z","0.2.0":"2016-03-25T10:54:04.403Z","0.1.5":"2016-02-11T12:41:48.014Z","0.1.4":"2015-12-02T13:31:23.790Z","0.1.3":"2015-11-30T15:10:19.103Z","0.1.2":"2015-11-30T13:14:58.040Z","0.1.1":"2015-11-30T12:25:52.357Z","0.1.0":"2015-11-28T01:25:19.860Z","0.13.3":"2023-08-05T03:41:19.574Z","0.13.4":"2023-08-08T03:49:15.854Z","0.13.5":"2023-08-16T05:15:08.077Z","0.13.6":"2023-08-16T18:34:44.790Z","0.13.7":"2023-08-19T17:38:10.486Z","0.13.8":"2023-10-23T06:03:10.486Z","0.13.9":"2024-09-03T06:05:45.058Z"},"versions":{"0.13.2":{"name":"eslint-import-resolver-webpack","version":"0.13.2","description":"Resolve paths to dependencies, given a webpack.config.js.
